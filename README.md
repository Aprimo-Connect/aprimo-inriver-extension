# aprimo-inriver-extension

The Aprimo inRiver Extension contains free documentation and sample code for a basic Aprimo DAM to inRiver SaaS integration. 

The Extension provides the following functionality: 
- Users may tag assets in the DAM with an inRiver entity type and unique Id, which will synchronize the asset to inRiver.
- Metadata may be mapped from inRiver back to the record in the DAM.

Please contact Aprimo for additional documentation about the inRiver extension
